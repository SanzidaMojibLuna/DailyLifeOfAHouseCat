# DailyLifeOfAHouseCat
As a huge cat lover I am, this was a passion project that I made showing what a day in the life of a house cat may be like.  This project is based on C++ mainly and OpenGL was used as well for graphics.  My cat model is obviously inspired by Pusheen (I am a big fan) and none of the soundtrack I used was made by me neither do I own them.
